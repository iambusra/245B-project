## Project Log

When we spin up a new project, the first thing we'll do to collect our thoughts is to create a [Notion project](https://www.notion.so/social-interaction-lab/010f6821fc4e4aa1b7ec07716fd6cdc1?v=028218a3e35a4c079194b04b347a4d09&pvs=4) or a Google Doc to function as a running "log" of project updates and meeting notes. 
The point is to have a file format that is easy to share and flexible in format. 
This Google Doc / Notion page is also where you should take notes during our meetings, and collect high-level TODO items, especially those that are not immediately actionable. 

## Preregistration

Once we are in the later stages of desigining a new human behavioral experiment and preparing to run our first pilot, we will write up a pre-registration and either put it under version control within the project repo OR post it to the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). We subscribe to the philosophy that ["pre-registrations are a plan, not a prison."](https://www.cos.io/blog/preregistration-plan-not-prison) They help us transparently document our thinking and decision-making process both for ourselves and for others, and will help us distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory findings. We do not believe that there is a single best way to write a pre-registration, but in many cases a more detailed plan will help us to clarify our experimental logic and set up our analyses accordingly (i.e., what each hypothesis predicts, which measures and analyses we will use to evaluate each relevant hypothesis).
